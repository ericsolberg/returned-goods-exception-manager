# Running App Foundation Agent Locally

This skill guides you through running an App Foundation agent locally for development and testing.

## ⚠️ Package Index Policy

All Python packages MUST be installed exclusively from the SAP PyPI proxy:
`https://int.repositories.cloud.sap/artifactory/api/pypi/proxy-3rd-party-pypi/simple`

NEVER use `https://pypi.org/simple` or any other external package index.
NEVER add `--extra-index-url` pointing to PyPI.
If a package is not found in the SAP proxy, report the error — do NOT fall back to PyPI.

The `install_deps.sh` script and virtualenv `pip.conf` enforce this. Do not override or bypass them.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the user has:

- **Python 3.13+** installed (verify with `python3 --version`)
- **AI Core credentials** (for LLM access)

## Workflow Overview

The complete workflow involves these steps:
1. Check credentials status (ALWAYS START HERE)
2. Choose setup method (Python venv or Docker)
3. Copy and configure credentials in `.env.local` from template
4. Set up the environment
5. Run the agent server
6. Test the agent with curl commands

**Important:** Guide the user through ALL steps. Don't stop after just one step - the goal is to have a running, tested agent.

---

## Step 0: Check Credentials Status (ALWAYS START HERE)

**Before anything else, use `AskUserQuestion` to check credentials:**

```
Question: "Do you have SAP AI Core credentials ready for local development?"

Options:
1. "Yes, I have AI Core credentials ready"
2. "I have some credentials but need help finding others"
3. "No, I need help getting all credentials"
```

**Based on response:**
- **Option 1:** Proceed to Step 1
- **Option 2:** Ask which they have, provide guidance for missing ones
- **Option 3:** Guide them to get credentials:
  - **AI Core:** BTP Subaccount → Service Instances → AI Core → Service Key

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

---

## Step 1: Choose Setup Method

Ask the user which setup method they prefer:

**Options:**
- "🐳 Docker (Recommended for WSL/Windows)"
- "🐍 Python Virtual Environment (Best for active development)"

After they choose, read the appropriate section from `references/setup-methods.md` and guide them through it.

### When to Read Setup Methods Reference

Read `references/setup-methods.md` to get detailed instructions for:
- Copying the `.env.local` template and filling in credentials
- Setting up Python virtual environment OR Docker
- Installing dependencies
- Running the agent server

The reference file contains complete commands and expected output for both methods.

---

## Step 2: Guide Through Setup

Based on their choice, walk them through:

1. **Copying `app/.env.local` from template**:
   ```bash
   SKILL_PATH=$(find . -type d -name "sap-agent-run-local" -path "*/skills/*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
   cp "$SKILL_PATH/templates/.env.local" app/.env.local
   ```
   Then edit with credentials
2. **Setting up the environment** (venv or Docker)
3. **Installing dependencies** (for Python venv) - **ALWAYS use the install script**:
   ```bash
   SKILL_PATH=$(find . -type d -name "sap-agent-run-local" -path "*/skills/*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
   bash "$SKILL_PATH/scripts/install_deps.sh"
   ```
   This prevents Ctrl+C interruption issues
4. **Running the agent** - the server will run in the foreground

**Key points to communicate:**
- **Use the install script, not manual pip install** - the script handles everything and prevents interruption errors
- The installation takes 3-5 minutes - wait for the "SUCCESS" message
- The agent server runs in the foreground and keeps the terminal busy
- They'll need to open a NEW terminal for testing
- When they see "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:9000", the server is ready

---

## Step 3: Test the Agent (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

Once the server is running, **you MUST run these tests**. Do not complete the skill without testing.

### Test 1: Verify Agent Card
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9000/.well-known/agent.json
```
**Expected:** JSON with agent name, description, capabilities.

### Test 2: Send Test Message (A2A Protocol)
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9000/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "message/send",
    "id": "test-1",
    "params": {
      "message": {
        "messageId": "msg-001",
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "Hello! What can you help me with?"}]
      }
    }
  }'
```
**Expected:** Response with `result.status.state: "completed"` and `result.artifacts` containing agent's reply.

### A2A Protocol Requirements
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:9000/` (root, NOT `/messages`)
- **MUST include `messageId`** in the message object
- Message uses `parts` array with `kind` and `text` fields
- Full JSON-RPC 2.0 format with `jsonrpc`, `method`, `id`, `params`

Read `references/testing.md` for multi-turn conversation examples and common mistakes.

---

## Step 4: Troubleshooting (If Needed)

If they encounter issues, read `references/troubleshooting.md` for solutions to common problems:
- Artifactory authentication failures
- AI Core connection issues
- Port conflicts
- Module not found errors
- Environment variable problems

The troubleshooting reference includes symptoms, solutions, and helper scripts.

---

## Quick Reference

For quick command lookups, refer to `references/quick-reference.md` which contains:
- Common commands for Python venv and Docker
- Testing commands
- Helper scripts
- Environment variable template
- Expected server output

---

## Helper Scripts

The skill includes utility scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

- **`install_deps.sh`** - Install Python dependencies. **Always use this instead of manual pip install** - it automatically creates the virtual environment (`.venv`) if it doesn't exist and provides clear progress feedback. Running pip manually can be interrupted by Ctrl+C, losing progress.
- `check_env.py` - Verify environment variables are set correctly
- `list_resource_groups.py` - List available AI Core resource groups
- `test_aicore.py` - Test AI Core connection
- `test_litellm.py` - Test LiteLLM integration

Use these when troubleshooting or verifying configuration.

---

## Communication Guidelines

**Be clear and encouraging:**
- Explain what each step does and why it's needed
- Set expectations (e.g., "This will take a few minutes")
- Confirm success at each step before moving forward
- Use the helper scripts to verify configuration when needed

**Don't assume success:**
- Wait for user confirmation after each command
- Check for error messages in their output
- If something fails, consult the troubleshooting reference

**Complete the full workflow:**
- Don't stop after just setting up - guide them through testing too
- Only use `attempt_completion` after the agent is running AND tested
- Verify they can successfully send messages to the agent

---

## Next Steps

After successfully running and testing locally, inform the user they can:
1. **Make changes** - Edit `app/agent.py` to customize behavior
2. **Test changes** - Restart the agent and test with curl
3. **Deploy** - Push to GitHub to trigger CI/CD deployment
4. **Test remotely** - Use the `sap-agent-test-remote` skill to test the deployed agent
